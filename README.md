# factorial_MIPS
A simple factorial code with comments in MIPS format for MARS simulator

"n" is the variable with value of 5 originally, which you can change to any value you would like it to calculate.

You can simply copy and paste the code into a new file on MARS simulator or download the file and run it in MARS simulator.

The "main" and "fact" code were from Chapter 2.8 'Supporting Procedures in Computer Hardware' on page 101, 102 on textbook: "COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND DESIGN, THE HARDWARE/SOFTWARE INTERFACE", FIFTH EDITION, BY DAVID A. PATTERSON & JOHN L. HENNESSY.
